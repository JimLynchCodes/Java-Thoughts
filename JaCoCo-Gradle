# Java Code Coverage Reports With JaCoCo





## Adding Code Coverage To An Existing Gradle Project

Make these two changes to your `build.gradle` file:

1) Add `id 'jacoco'` to the plugins section: 

```groovy
plugins {
    id "java"
    id 'jacoco'
}
```

2) At the bottom of the file add this block of groovy configuration code:

```groovy
jacocoTestReport {
    reports {
        xml.required = false
        csv.required = false
        html.outputLocation = layout.buildDirectory.dir('jacocoHtml')
    }
}
```

Then run the command to generate the report: 
```bash
gradle build jacocoTestReport
```

View the report by opening the `/build/jacocoHtml/index.html` file in your browser.
